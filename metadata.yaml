description: "In His Steps is a best-selling religious fiction novel written by Charles\
  \ Monroe Sheldon. First published in 1896, the book has sold more than 30,000,000\
  \ copies, and ranks as one of the best-selling books of all time. The full title\
  \ of the book is In His Steps: What Would Jesus Do?.\nThough variations of the subtitle\
  \ \"What would Jesus do\" have been used by Christians for centuries as a form of\
  \ imitatio dei, the imitation of God, it gained much greater currency following\
  \ publication of the book.\nChicago Advance, the original publisher, failed to register\
  \ the copyright in the proper form. Other publishers took advantage of this, publishing\
  \ the book without paying the author royalties. Thus lower prices and multiple publishers\
  \ led to larger sales.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
